# BLE Advertisement Packet Parser
An exercise I did to learn about BLE (used [Bluetooth Advertisement Data Basics](https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/2.13/bluetooth-fundamentals-advertising-scanning/bluetooth-adv-data-basics) as a resource). It would probably have made more sense to start with a BLE packet parser and work my way down. 

## TODO
Note to myself: found this nice website [Bluetooth Low Energy Fundamentals](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/courses/bluetooth-low-energy-fundamentals/lessons/lesson-1-bluetooth-low-energy-introduction/") which seems like a great resource to get a structured overview of the whole topic.
